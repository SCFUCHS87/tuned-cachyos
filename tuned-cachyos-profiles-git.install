• Enable tuned (if not already):  sudo systemctl enable --now tuned
• List profiles:                   tuned-adm list
• Activate a profile:              sudo tuned-adm profile <profile-name>
Note: These are in /etc so your local edits persist. Consider adding your profile tuned.conf
to the PKGBUILD 'backup=()' array once names are stable.
